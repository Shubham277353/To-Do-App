1 empty project array contains objects with both the project name and the tasks inside it .
Every project object will have its own tasks.
There will be a activeProject variable containing the index of the project .
We have multiple FUNC to manipuate the array : 
    addProject - adds project,
    addTasks - adds tasks to the project object with the activeProject as the pointer - project[activeProject].
    switchProject - to switch project.
SET each FUNC to EXPORT
